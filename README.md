**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository**

Welcome to my repository showcasing various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in different programming languages. This repository is designed to help with learning and reference for fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find implementations of common data structures and algorithms including:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- **Sorting Algorithms** (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
- **Searching Algorithms** (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
